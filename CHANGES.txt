Changelog
=========

1.0 (unreleased)
----------------

- Relax the pinned requirement on elementtree.

0.9 (2009-05-10)
----------------

- Made the `pyprof2calltree` dependency conditional on the Python version.
  This package depends on Python >= 2.5.

0.8 (2009-02-25)
----------------

- Added optional support for directly writing out the profiling data in the
  KCacheGrind format.

- Avoid a dependency on `elementtree` when used with Python 2.5 and later.
  In those Python versions we used the built-in xml.etree support.

0.7 (2009-02-08)
----------------

- ``discard_first_request = true`` did not work!

- Added tests for ``discard_first_request`` and ``flush_at_shutdown``.

- Converted CHANGES.txt to ReST.

- Bump ez_setup.py version.

0.6 (2008-08-21)
----------------

- ``discard_first_request = false`` did not work.

- Clearing the profile data from the user interface did not properly
   discard profiler state.

0.5 (2008-06-11)
----------------

- Initial PyPI release.

0.4 (2008-05-07)
----------------

- Remove dependency-link to http://dist.repoze.org to prevent
  easy_install from adding that to its search path.

- Incorporated a patch from Alec Flett <alecf@metaweb.com> to uses
  ``cProfile``, if available, rather than pure Python ``profile``.

- Bump ez_setup.py version.

0.3 (2008-02-20)
----------------

- Added compatibility with Python 2.5.

  but meld isn't a setuptools package.
